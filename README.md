### CPU Scheduling compute:
- Compute avg of TAT, WT, RT for RR, FCFS, preemptive priority, preemptive SJF
- Draw a gantt chart
### GUI
- Require: arrival time, burst time
- For some case like RR we need quantum time, the default value is 2. Also the priority default is 1. So when you deal with preemptive priority\

- Fill the attribute you need and "Add Process" to add process into the list
- Run the case you want to compute the avg and visual the gantt chart
- It will show you the board like this (the y axis is the process axis, the x axis is the time axis)\

### Some important notes:
- You need to reset all after each Run algorithm.
  For example after you run RR and you can not run the SJF right after in the GUI, you need to "Reset All" get the input attribute again.(issue)
